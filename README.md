# Decentalized-To-Do-List
Implemented a Decentralized To-Do List using Ethereum Smart Contracts using Truffle Framework. The user can create list of tasks according to their priority and check them off once done. The web app provides a user-friendly web app UI for the to-do list. The Metamask Wallet is required in order to process the transcations on the Ethereum Blockchain. The app helps the user to be organised and also acts as a memory aid.
